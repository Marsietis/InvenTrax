## An Inventory tracking windows desktop application.

### This is a Programming languages and object-oriented programming course task.

Task:

'''
Our company and its partners want to develop a system to manage goods.

The number of partners is subject to change. This means that our company's IT administrator can add or drop certain partners. The partner company must appoint its own IT administrator or even several. Each of them must therefore be given the possibility to register or be given already generated login data.

In the graphical interface, the partner would be able to see the products of his department. However, in case of need, the partner could also view the product he is looking for with other partners. For example: one company does not have a certain computer component, but the system shows that another company has this product.

Let's not forget that each product must have the following properties: Name, product code, price, features/specifications. The features must be universal. 2 examples:

- Item - "Intel Core i7 - 13900K", Code - "100022004310", Price - 600EUR, Features:
Number of cores - 24, Number of Performance cores - 8, Efficient cores - 24, Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology - "Yes", Intel® Speed Shift Technology - "Yes", TJUNCTION - "100°C".

- Product - "AirPods Pro (2nd generation)", Code - "18667846879", Price - 230.99 EUR, Features:
"Bluetooth 5.3 wireless technology - Yes, Speech-detecting accelerometer - Yes, Adaptive Transparency - Yes.

The price may be different with each of our partners, but the product code must be identical everywhere.

We would like the app to notify our partner that their goods are running low when they are running low.
 

The login GUI is at your discretion. There should be a User Name input, a Password input and corresponding buttons.

Product search must be by product code or product name.
